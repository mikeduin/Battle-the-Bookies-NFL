       <span class="btb">Battle the Bookies</span> allows you to test your football handicapping skills against both the oddsmakers in Vegas and your fellow game entrants by requiring you to make a single, <i>theoretical</i> $100 bet on every game of the NFL season. Again: that's a <i>fake</i> $100 bet, used just as a vehicle for scorekeeping ... no need for a $10k bankroll to play this game! Your $100 bet on each game can be made in one of three ways:

       The odds for a game will be posted on the <a ui-sref="home.makepicks">Make Picks</a> page as soon as they are set by real-life oddsmakers, and they will change leading up to a game's start time anytime they change in real life. Rather than offering a static, rigid line at a random point prior to the game, <span class="btb">Battle the Bookies</span> simulates a real-life handicapping environment by allowing an entrant to "lock in" a pick at any time from when a line is first posted to when the game begins. Once a pick has been submitted, it cannot be changed (otherwise, an entrant would be able to switch their pick and obtain a better line any time the real-life odds moved in their favor).

       If you win your bet, your game score will be credited with the <i> payout </i> amount that was indicated at the time your bet was placed; if you lose your bet, your score will be a hit with a -$100 loss. Note that a missed or otherwise unsubmitted pick will count as an automatic -$100 loss; if this were not the case, entrants who built up a lead could simply stop picking games until/unless they were caught by their opponents.

        Each pick starts with a base capperGrade of 10. For <b>Spread</b> and <b>Total</b> picks, a pick's capperGrade is reduced by the difference between an entrant's selection and the best number ever available for that pick type. From there, a similar calculation is made based on the juice on your pick and the best juice ever available for your selection, and your CapperGrade is reduced by 0.1 for every five cents of difference in juice. <b>Click the image to the right</b> to see a detailed example.

        The calculations for <b>Moneyline</b> picks are a bit simpler: a pick's starting capperGrade of 10 is reduced by 0.5 for every 20 points in difference between that pick's moneyline and the best moneyline ever available for that selection. This is admittedly a bit inexact, but after running some numbers, 20 points of moneyline movement seemed roughly equivalent to 0.5 points of spread movement.
