       <span class="btb">Battle the Bookies</span> allows you to test your football handicapping skills against both the oddsmakers in Vegas and your fellow game entrants by requiring you to make a single, <i>theoretical</i> $100 bet on every game of the NFL season. Again: that's a <i>fake</i> $100 bet, used just as a vehicle for scorekeeping ... no need for a $10k bankroll to play this game! Your $100 bet on each game can be made in one of three ways:

If a team is <b>favored</b> by 6.5 points, they must win the game by at least seven points to cover the spread. If a team is a 6.5-point <b>underdog</b>, they will cover the spread as long as they do not lose the game by seven points or more.

       The odds for a game will be posted on the <a ui-sref="home.makepicks">Make Picks</a> page as soon as they are set by real-life oddsmakers, and they will change leading up to a game's start time anytime they change in real life. Rather than offering a static, rigid line at a random point prior to the game, <span class="btb">Battle the Bookies</span> simulates a real-life handicapping environment by allowing an entrant to "lock in" a pick at any time from when a line is first posted to when the game begins. Once a pick has been submitted, it cannot be changed (otherwise, an entrant would be able to switch their pick and obtain a better line any time the real-life odds moved in their favor).

       If you win your bet, your game score will be credited with the <i> payout </i> amount that was indicated at the time your bet was placed; if you lose your bet, your score will be a hit with a -$100 loss. Note that a missed or otherwise unsubmitted pick will count as an automatic -$100 loss; if this were not the case, entrants who built up a lead could simply stop picking games until/unless they were caught by their opponents.
