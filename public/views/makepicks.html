        - Queue up a pick by clicking its button, then click the green checkmark to confirm your pick. A pick is not submitted until it's confirmed.

        - A submitted pick locks in the odds and price of the pick at time of submission, even if the odds change prior to the game's start time.

        - Make sure to get each pick in before each game begins! A game locks at its scheduled start time; per the game rules, a missed/unsubmitted pick is an automatic loss.

        - <b>If you have queued up a pick but have not confirmed it, it may disappear from the 'confirm' area in the event that odds refresh.</b> This is expected behavior and is in place to ensure that an entrant is not able to select a stale line. Odds refresh every 30 seconds.
